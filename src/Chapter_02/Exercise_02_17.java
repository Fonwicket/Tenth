/**
 * How cold is it outside? The temperature alone is not enough to provide
 * the answer. Other factors including wind speed, relative humidity, and sunshine play
 * important roles in determining coldness outside. In 2001, the National Weather Service
 * (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill temperature to measure the coldness using
 * temperature and wind speed. The formula is
 * <p>
 * 35.74 + (0.6215 * temperature) - (35,75 * Math.pow(windSpeed, 0.16)) +
 * (0.4275 * temperature * Math.pow(windSpeed, 0.16))
 * <p>
 * The formula cannot be used for speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below -58째F or
 * above 41째F
 * <p>
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58F and 41F
 * and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 and display the wind-chill temperature.
