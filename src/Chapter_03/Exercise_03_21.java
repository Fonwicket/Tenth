/**
 * Zellerâ€™s  congruence  is  an  algorithm  developed  by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week.
 * The formula is
 * h= (q + ((26 * m + 1) / 10) + k + (k / 4) + (j / 4) + 5 * j) % 7
 * <p>
 * where:
 * h is the day of the week (0: Saturday, 1: Sunday, 2: Monday, 3: Tuesday, 4: Wednesday, 5: Thursday, 6: Friday).
 * q is the day of the month.
 * m is the month (3: March, 4: April, ..., 12: December). January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.
 * j is the century (i.e., year / 100 ).
 * k is the year of the century (i.e., year % 100).
 * Note that the division in the formula performs an integer division. Write a program
 * that  prompts  the  user  to  enter  a  year,  month,  and  day  of  the  month,  and
 * displays the name of the day of the week.
 *
 * (Hint: January and February are counted as 13 and 14 in the formula, so you need
 * to convert the user input 1 to 13 and 2 to 14 for the month and change the year to
 * the previous year.)
